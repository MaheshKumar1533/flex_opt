    - âœ… Course Selection System
    - âœ… Workshop/Event Registration
    - âœ… Resource Allocation
    - âœ… Any custom selection scenario

4. **Easy Configuration**

    - Interactive configuration script (`./configure.sh`)
    - Configuration examples in `CONFIGURATION.md`
    - Detailed documentation for customization

5. **Preserved All Functionality**
    - âœ… Real-time WebSocket updates
    - âœ… Multi-quiz support
    - âœ… Dynamic subject slot tracking
    - âœ… Admin interface

## ðŸš€ Current Configuration

The system is currently configured as:

-   **Site Name**: Training Program Selection
-   **Logo**: Training Hub
-   **Subject Type**: Training Program
-   **Sample Data**: Java, .NET, Database, Python, DevOps, Frontend training programs

## ðŸ”„ How to Change for Your Use Case

### Option 1: Use Configuration Script

```bash
./configure.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Edit `SITE_CONFIG` in `flex_opt/settings.py`:

```python
SITE_CONFIG = {
    'SITE_NAME': 'Your System Name',
    'SITE_DESCRIPTION': 'Your description',
    'SITE_LOGO_TEXT': 'Your Logo',
    'DEFAULT_QUIZ_TYPE': 'Your Quiz Type',
    'DEFAULT_SUBJECT_TYPE': 'Your Subject Type',
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

The database schema is completely generic:

-   **Students**: Can represent any type of participants
-   **Subjects**: Can represent courses, programs, workshops, resources, etc.
-   **Quizzes**: Can represent any selection/registration event
-   **Responses**: Track selections/assignments

## ðŸŽ¨ White-Label Ready

The system is now completely white-label and can be deployed for:

-   Educational institutions (electives, courses)
-   Corporations (training, workshops)
-   Event organizers (registration, workshops)
-   Resource managers (booking, allocation)
-   Any scenario requiring first-come-first-served selection

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

-   **Context Processor**: Makes configuration available globally
-   **Template Variables**: `{{ site_config.SITE_NAME }}`, etc.
-   **Dynamic Content**: All user-facing text adapts automatically
-   **Backward Compatible**: Existing data works with new configuration
-   **No Migration Required**: Database schema unchanged

## âœ¨ Result

You now have a **fully reusable, dynamic selection system** that can be easily configured for any use case without touching the source code. Just update the configuration and you're ready to go!
